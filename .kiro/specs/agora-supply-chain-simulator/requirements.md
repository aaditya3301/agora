# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Agora is an automated supply chain and logistics simulator designed for a college hackathon prototype. The system simulates a simplified city supply chain where multiple autonomous agents (stores, warehouses, factories, and trucks) cooperate to meet dynamic consumer demand. The focus is on creating a basic but functional multi-agent system that demonstrates supply chain coordination without overly complex algorithms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to see a visual simulation of agents interacting in a supply chain, so that I can understand how multi-agent coordination works in real-world logistics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation starts THEN the system SHALL display a simple city map with factories, warehouses, and stores
2. WHEN agents perform actions THEN the system SHALL show visual indicators of their activities (orders, deliveries, production)
3. WHEN the simulation runs THEN the system SHALL update the display in real-time to show agent movements and inventory changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each agent type to be implemented in separate files, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows good architecture principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing agents THEN the system SHALL have separate files for each agent type (Store, Warehouse, Factory, Truck, Market)
2. WHEN agents communicate THEN the system SHALL use a clear messaging interface between agents
3. WHEN adding new agent behaviors THEN the system SHALL allow easy extension without modifying other agent files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a store agent, I want to monitor my inventory and place orders when stock is low, so that I can meet customer demand without running out of products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inventory falls below a threshold THEN the store agent SHALL automatically place an order to the warehouse
2. WHEN customers make purchases THEN the store agent SHALL decrease its inventory accordingly
3. WHEN receiving deliveries THEN the store agent SHALL update its inventory levels

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a warehouse agent, I want to receive orders from stores and coordinate deliveries, so that I can efficiently distribute products across the supply chain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving orders from stores THEN the warehouse agent SHALL check its inventory availability
2. WHEN inventory is available THEN the warehouse agent SHALL dispatch a truck for delivery
3. WHEN inventory is low THEN the warehouse agent SHALL place orders with the factory

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a factory agent, I want to produce goods based on warehouse orders, so that I can maintain supply chain flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving orders from warehouses THEN the factory agent SHALL add them to its production queue
2. WHEN production is complete THEN the factory agent SHALL notify the warehouse and update inventory
3. WHEN production capacity is reached THEN the factory agent SHALL queue additional orders

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a truck agent, I want to transport goods between locations, so that deliveries can be completed in the supply chain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assigned a delivery THEN the truck agent SHALL move from its current location to the pickup point
2. WHEN at pickup location THEN the truck agent SHALL load cargo and proceed to delivery destination
3. WHEN delivery is complete THEN the truck agent SHALL notify relevant agents and become available for new assignments

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a market simulation agent, I want to create dynamic demand patterns, so that the supply chain faces realistic challenges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation runs THEN the market agent SHALL periodically update demand at different stores
2. WHEN demand changes THEN the market agent SHALL notify affected store agents
3. WHEN special events occur THEN the market agent SHALL create demand spikes or drops

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see basic performance metrics, so that I can evaluate how well the supply chain is functioning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation runs THEN the system SHALL track total sales revenue
2. WHEN inventory costs are incurred THEN the system SHALL calculate storage costs
3. WHEN stockouts occur THEN the system SHALL track lost sales penalties
4. WHEN the simulation ends THEN the system SHALL display overall performance metrics
